# EEF Data Science Challenge

## Overview
This project was developed for the **EEF Data Science Challenge**, where I performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data processing and trained a machine learning model using **XGBoost**. The project leverages **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** for data handling, analysis, and visualization.

## Objective
Predict based on multiple weather features if a flight is going to wait or not to take off.

## Features
- ETL pipeline for processing raw datasets
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- Visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Training and evaluation of an **XGBoost** model
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance metrics and model optimization

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computation)
- **Metar** (Weather Data Processing)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **XGBoost** (Machine Learning Model)
